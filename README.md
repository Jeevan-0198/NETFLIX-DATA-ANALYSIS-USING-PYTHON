# NETFLIX-DATA-ANALYSIS-USING-PYTHON
## OBJECTIVE
The objective of the project is to analyze and visualize the given Netflix data using Pandas and Matplotlib. Additionally, this project answers various questions based on project requirements, providing valuable business insights and supporting future development.
## DATASETS
<a herf="">Datasets</a> used here doesn't refelct original datasets of netflix.  
Includes fileds such as Show_Id,Category,Title,Director,Cast,Country,Release_Date	Rating,Duration,Type,Description.
## EXPLANATION
### Libraries Used:
- **Pandas**(Pandas used for Data Cleaning),
- **Seaborn**(Seaborn used for Data Visualisation)
### Data Cleaning
- First, I removed duplicates using the drop_duplicates() function.
- Next, I identified, visualized, and removed null values to ensure data completeness.
- I extracted and separated the Date column to facilitate better analysis and visualized year-wise data trends.
- I identified unique values in relevant columns as part of the data cleaning process to ensure consistency and accuracy.
### Visualisation
- I made some of the visualisation for better understanding of datas
   - I visualise null values using heatmaps of seaborn.

   - I visualise year-wise release of movies using vertical bar charts.
